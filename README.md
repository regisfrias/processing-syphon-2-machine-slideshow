# Processingâ€“Syphon 2-machine slideshow

This is a simple application (server) that sends a slideshow via Syphon to another program and an OSC message to another computer (or program) running the client application.

- `spacebar` or `right arrow` move slideshow forward
- `left arrow` move slideshow backward

The text in the slideshow comes from a .txt file inside the `data` folder in both applications (Server and Client). Each line is a slide.
